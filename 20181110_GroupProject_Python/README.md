# Project_GroupF

Our project was to understand whether or not race, gender, time of day, and precinct correlate to police stops in Minneapolis. 
For this analysis, police stops included traffic stops, suspicious person stops, and suspicious vehicle stops. 

We asked our questions about these factors to evaluate the data for bias in treatment of people living and traveling through Minneapolis, which would have unfair negative consequences (legal, financial, personal, opportunity cost).
